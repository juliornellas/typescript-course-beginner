//CONST. Can't change to "hello: string" because CONST you cannot change at all. So if you pass mouse over "hello" you'll' see "world" as a type. Like was a specific type
const hello = "world";
// hello = "planet";

//LET. You can assign the types. Pass mouse over "world", now, the type is "string"
let world = "hello";
